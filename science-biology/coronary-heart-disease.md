# Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)

## Causes
Results from the blockage of coronary arteries by fatty deposits. This starves the heart muscles of oxygen which causes chest pains. If it is left untreated, it will eventually lead to a heart attack.

People who are obese are more likely to contract CHD because they build up fat more than healthy people. This can also lead to type 2 diabetes, arthritis or liver disease.

## Treatment
CHD can be treated by clearing the blockages using a procedure known as angioplasty or using a bypass operation.
