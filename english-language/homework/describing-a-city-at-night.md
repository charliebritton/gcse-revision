## Describing a City at Night
*By Charlie Britton 11O*

It was ten o'clock in the evening and all was going well at Pennyfarthing Square. All of the oil lamps had been lit and the fountain was happily flowing away. All of the houses surrounding the square were quiet and still. A gust of wind blew past and knocked some of the delightful Christmas Wreaths off some doors.

The bunting flapped slowly. All seemed desolate until suddenly a strange cat ran around the corner and hid in a bush as a fox frantically chased her. Feeling a drop of rain on his back, the fox turned around and scampered for the nearby alleyway to seek shelter.

Although the cat was unsure as to whether or not the fox had gone, he peeked his head out and saw that the square had begun to turn white! A huge amount of snow had begun to fall and engulfed the square in its thick soft whiteness.

As the night went on and the snow got heavier and heavier, the square began to turn into a wonderland of white and the fountain began to freeze. By six o'clock, all of the children had woken up to see this beautiful scene. Glowing faces rushed outside and had begun to build massive snowmen and catapulted snowballs back and forth. "Merry Christmas", they cheered.
