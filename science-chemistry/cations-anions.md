## What is a Cation (Cat ion)?
A cation is an ion (e.g. Ag<sup>+</sup>) which has a positive charge (usually a metal) which means that it will transfer to the negative electrode (aka a cathode) to form a neutral bond.

You can remember that a cation is positive because cats are happy :)

## What is an Anion?
An anion is an ion with a negative charge and is usually a non-metal (such as Cl<sup>-</sup>). These anions cling to the anode in electrolysis.
