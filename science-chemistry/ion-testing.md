## What is it?
The tests and results noted below are required for the GCSE and need to be known.

ppt. = precipitate.

### Cations
| Cation           | Test: Addition of NaOH                                                                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aluminium, Al3+  | White ppt. of Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> forms and dissolves into a colourless solution with excess NaOH |
| Calcium, Ca2+    | White precipitate of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> forms and is insoluble in NaOH                           |
| Magnesium, Mg2+  | White precipitate of Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> forms and is insoluble in excess NaOH                    |
| Copper(II), Cu2+ | Blue precipitate Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> forms.                                                       |
| Iron(II), Fe2+   | Green precipitate of Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> forms.                                                   |
| Iron(III), Fe3+  | Brown precipitate of Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> forms.                                                         |
