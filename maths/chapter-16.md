## Averages & Spread 2

You can put large amounts of data into a grouped frequency table.
You use estimates of averages to summarise the data.

You can calculate the estimated mean, the modal class and the class interval from a grouped frequency table.

## Box Plots and Cumulative Frequency Graphs

Cumulative frequency plots the total up until that point.

A box plot is drawn as such:

## Scatter graphs and Correlation

Scatter graphs compare 2 sets of data.

If the points lie rougly in a straight line, there is a linear relationship or correlation between the two variables.

You can get strong and weak positive and negative correlations or no correlation at all.

Correlation != causation.

## Time seties
You can use a line graph to show how data changes as time passes.

Data can be discrete or continuous.

A time series graph shows the trend and each individual value.

You can get seasonal variations.
