## Equation of a Straight Line

You need 2 pieces of info to specify a straight line.
Usually gradient and y-intercept

The gradient defines steepness, y-intercept shows where the line crosses the y-axis.

y = mx + c

gradient = y/x

## Linear and Quadratic Functions

Graphs of y = mx + c are always straight lines

A quadratic graph features a ^2 term and is a parabola with a vertical line of symmetry.

## Properties of Quadratic Functions

A parabola has a line of symmetry. The point where the line crosses the line of symmetry is the turning point.

The x-intercepts of a graph are called the roots.

## Kinematic Graphs

A distance time graph shows info about a journey.

The gradient of a straight line = speed of the object.

Speed time graphs also give info about a journey.

The gradient = acceleration and the area under the line is the distance travelled.
