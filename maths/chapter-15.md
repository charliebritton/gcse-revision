# Working in 3D

## 3D shapes

A solid is a 3D shape you can draw it on isometric paper.

A prism has the same cross section throughout its length

Cubes, cuboids and cylinders are all prisms.

The base of a pyramid is a polygon the other faces are triangles.

A net is a 2D shape that can be folded to make a 3D shape.

3D shapes can be represented by plans and elevations.

## Volume of a Prism

Volume is the amount of space occupied by a 3D object.
Capacity is the amount of fluid a container can hold.

Liquids = ml and l.

Volume of Prism = Cross Sectional Area x length
Volume of Cuboid = L x W x H
Volume of Cylinder = pi x r^2 x height
Mass = Volume x Density

## Volume and Surface Area

Curved surface area of cylinder = 2pi x r x h
Curved surface area of cone = pi x r x slant height
Surface area of a sphere = 4 x pi x r^3
