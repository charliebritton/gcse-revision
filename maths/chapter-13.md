# Chapter 13 Revision

## Factors & Multiples

A prime number has only 2 factors, 1 and itself.
Any integer can be written as a product of its prime factors.
990 as a product of prime factors:
990 = 10 x 99

10 = 2 x 5
99 = 9 x 11

9 = 3 x 3

2 x 3^2 x 5 x 11


The HCF of the 2 numbers is the highest factor they have in common.
The LCM of the two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.

## Powers & Roots

A square root is a number that when multiplied by itself twice equals a given number
A cube root is the same but applies 3x

e.g.

√25 = 5 because 5 x 5 = 25

3√64 = 4 because 4 x 4 = 16. 16 x 4 = 64

Laws of indices
4.6 x 4.6 x 4.6 = 4.6^3

5^3 x 5^4 = 5^7
5^4 / 5^3 = 5^1 = 5
(5^2)^4 = 5^8
n^0 = 1 except for 0

## Surds

A surd is an irational number that cannot be written as a fraction, a finite decimal or recurring decimal.

√2, √3 & √5 are surds.

Surds can be simplified by looking at their factors

e.g. √20 = √(4 x 5) = √4 √5 = 2√5
